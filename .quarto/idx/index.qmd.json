Additionally, there is also a positive correlation occurring between days 50-100, indicating that there is a strong relationship between the proportion of recorded jumps per day.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe data suggests that meaningful physical development, such as improvements in jump intensity, typically happen when a player has been with the program for more than one season. One season players show more inconsistency, while those who stay longer show much more steady progress.

We recommend to the Director of Recruiting to keep players around and recruit athletes who are eager to grow with the program. To support this, the program should focus on strengthening relationships with players and fostering a team culture that encourages playing for multiple years.
