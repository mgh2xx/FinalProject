# Report

## Prepared For

**UVA Men’s Basketball Director of Recruiting, along with the Recruiting Staff**

## Problem Statement

The landscape of college men's basketball is evolving as we know it. With the possibility for players to receive earnings through the NIL, more and more athletes are undergoing transfers between programs. Although this shift has brought opportunity for many players and has given smaller programs more appeal, it has also disrupted programs like the University of Virginia (UVA) Men’s basketball team, who has historically relied on player development for much of their success. Can this model still hold up in this new fast-moving environment?

Our report will examine how a player’s physical development evolves over one or more seasons using Catapult Sports performance data, and will consider what that means for UVA’s future recruitment strategies. After doing this, our results should approach an answer to our central question: **How should the Director of Recruiting of the Men’s Basketball Program approach player recruitment in the transfer-heavy landscape of modern college basketball?**

## Analysis

![](./images/viz_1.png)

When examining the high-band jump proportions of top players across both seasons, the one-season player group shows notable volatility, with no consistent upward trend. In contrast, players who returned for a second season exhibited steady and continued improvement in jump intensity. This suggests that meaningful gains in explosive performance tend to emerge only after a second season of training or competition.

Narrowing the focus on Athlete C’s data over the two seasons, it’s clear that he has shown significant continued growth in jump performance. This is highlighted by the steady increase of high-band proportion, which plateaus towards the latter half of the first season, but then reignites its growth throughout the duration of the second season.

Examining the change in the mean proportion of jumps in the high band by day for one- and two-season players, it is clear that the two-season players have shown the greater increase in mean proportion of jumps in the high band. The upward trend in mean high-band jump proportion for two-season players and the contrasting downward trend for one-season players shows the value of a second season in the program for physical development.


## Conclusion

The data suggests that meaningful physical development, such as improvements in jump intensity, typically happen when a player has been with the program for more than one season. One season players show more inconsistency, while those who stay longer show much more steady progress. This reinforces the effectiveness of UVA’s traditional player development strategy and highlights the importance of player retention. Players should not be treated like they are disposable. We recommend to the Director of Recruiting to recruit high-school players who are eager to grow with and remain a part of the program, and use the transfer portal to recruit upperclassman players near or at their peak physical development. To support this, the program should focus on strengthening relationships with incoming players and fostering a team culture that encourages playing for multiple years.
