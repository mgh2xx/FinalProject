# Report

## Prepared For

## Problem Statement

The landscape of college men's basketball is evolving as we know it. With the recent implementation of the one-time transfer rule, as well as the possibility for players to receive earnings through the NIL, more and more athletes are undergoing transfers between programs. Although this shift has brought opportunity for many players and has given smaller programs more appeal, it has also disrupted programs like the University of Virginia (UVA) Men’s basketball team, who has historically relied on player development for much of their success. Can this model still hold up in this new fast-moving environment?

Our report will examine how a player’s physical development evolves over one or more seasons using Catapult Sports performance data, and will consider what that means for UVA’s future recruitment strategies. After doing this, our results should approach an answer to our central question: **How should the Director of Recruiting of the Men’s Basketball Program approach player recruitment in the transfer of modern college basketball?**
