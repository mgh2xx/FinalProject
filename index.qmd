# Report

## Prepared For

## Problem Statement

The landscape of college men's basketball is evolving as we know it. With the recent implementation of the one-time transfer rule, as well as the possibility for players to receive earnings through the NIL, more and more athletes are undergoing transfers between programs. Although this shift has brought opportunity for many players and has given smaller programs more appeal, it has also disrupted programs like the University of Virginia (UVA) Men’s basketball team, who has historically relied on player development for much of their success. Can this model still hold up in this new fast-moving environment?

Our report will examine how a player’s physical development evolves over one or more seasons using Catapult Sports performance data, and will consider what that means for UVA’s future recruitment strategies. After doing this, our results should approach an answer to our central question: **How should the Director of Recruiting of the Men’s Basketball Program approach player recruitment in the transfer of modern college basketball?**

## Analysis

When examining the high-band jump proportions of top players across both seasons, the one-season player group shows notable volatility, with no consistent upward trend. In contrast, players who returned for a second season exhibited steady and continued improvement in jump intensity. This suggests that meaningful gains in explosive performance tend to emerge only after a second season of training or competition.

Narrowing the focus on Athlete C’s data over the two seasons, it’s clear that he has shown significant continued growth in jump performance. This is highlighted by the steady increase of high-band proportion, which plateaus towards the latter half of the first season, but then reignites its growth throughout the duration of the second season.

Examining the change in the mean proportion of jumps in the high band by day for one- and two-season players, it is clear that the two-season players have shown the greatest change in the mean proportion of jumps in the high band, further contributing to their improved performance. This is demonstrated by the steady increase in the proportion of jumps as the graph continues day by day without decreasing. Additionally, there is also a positive correlation occurring between days 50-100, indicating that there is a strong relationship between the proportion of recorded jumps per day.


## Conclusion

The data suggests that meaningful physical development, such as improvements in jump intensity, typically happen when a player has been with the program for more than one season. One season players show more inconsistency, while those who stay longer show much more steady progress. This reinforces the effectiveness of UVA’s traditional player development strategy and highlights the importance of player retention. Players should not be treated like they are disposable. We recommend to the Director of Recruiting to keep players around and recruit athletes who are eager to grow with the program. To support this, the program should focus on strengthening relationships with players and fostering a team culture that encourages playing for multiple years.
