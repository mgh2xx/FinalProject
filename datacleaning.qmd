# Loading in data from season 1 and 2
s1 = pd.read_csv("./data/catapult season 1.csv")

# Adding column with season to each dataset
s1["Season"] = 1
s2["Season"] = 2

# Combining the two seasons of data into a single data frame
data = pd.concat([s1, s2])

# Converting date column to datetime
data["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(data["Date"])

# Ignoring the UserWarning raised by the above line. The warning raised tells me that not setting a specific format or handing errors could be problematic, but further
# examination of the Date column showed that it is not, so I am hiding the warning from printing
warnings.simplefilter(action = "ignore", category = UserWarning)

# List of Variables Relevant to our Project
columns_of_interest = ["Date", "About", "Period", "Player Load Per Minute", "IMA Accel Low", "IMA Accel High", "IMA Accel Total", "IMA Jump Count Low Band", "IMA Jump Count Med Band", "IMA Jump Count High Band", "Season"]

# Filtering data frame to include only relevant variables
data = data[columns_of_interest]
